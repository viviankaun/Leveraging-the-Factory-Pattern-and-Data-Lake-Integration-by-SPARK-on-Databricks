# Leveraging-the-Factory-Pattern-and-Data-Lake-Integration-by-SPARK-on-Databricks
This repository showcases an advanced data engineering project using Apache Spark on Databricks. The project focuses on implementing the Factory pattern for building a modular and scalable ETL pipeline. It also demonstrates best practices for integrating and optimizing data workflows within a Data Lake environment. Through this project, we explore Spark's capabilities to process, transform, and analyze large datasets, providing actionable insights into customer behaviors, specifically within the context of Apple product sales.
